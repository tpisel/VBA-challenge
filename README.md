# VBA-challenge

No external code or other content has been used in this project, except where specifically provided in the assignment resources.

The `stocksummariser.vbs` code includes two 'sub' procedures:

- `stocksummariser_onesheet` (apply the function to the active sheet)
- `stocksummariser_allsheets` (loop through all sheets)

Running the script on the smaller sample files usually only takes a few  minutes, but running across the full, multi-year data will likely take 20-30 minutes.
